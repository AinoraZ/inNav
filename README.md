Indoors Navigation app (W.I.P. prototype)

This is a prototype version for an app that will let people find their way indoors more easily (supermarkets, airports, universities, etc).

This app will be paired with a map making platform, that lets the users create maps easily, add various information to certain points like stores, etc.

This is just the experimental version, a prototype. It will not be built in unity in it's final release.
